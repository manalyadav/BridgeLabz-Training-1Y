//An athlete runs in a triangular park with sides provided as input by the user in meters. If the
//athlete wants to complete a 5 km run, then how many rounds must the athlete complete
//Hint =>
//a. Take user input for 3 sides of a triangle
//b. The perimeter of a triangle is the addition of all sides and rounds is distance/perimeter
//c. Write a Method to compute the number of rounds user needs to do to complete 5km run
